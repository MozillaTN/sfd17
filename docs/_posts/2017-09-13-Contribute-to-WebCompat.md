In our Fifth step we are going to start contributing to Localization Community.

## Why WebCompat

Most of the developers forget there are many browsers in this world. The aim of this project is to make sure websites behave in an similar fashion across all the browser.

### How helpful it is

In office a full stack developer has to make sure, his feature is working properly in all major browsers. If it breaks in any one of the browser it means he is going to loose some share of users.

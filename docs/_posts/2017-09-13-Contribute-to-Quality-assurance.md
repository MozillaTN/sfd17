In our seventh step we are going to start contributing to MDN. For this it is good to have github account.

## Why QA

Firefox is used in many devices. There are lot of android devices, ios devices and desktop with different Operating Systems and different hardware configuration. To test in every device available in this world is not easy. So contributors around world test Firefox in their device and share the bugs they face.

### How helpful it is

No software development is complete without Quality assurance. When we write them it should be checked well and checked at different hardware. When I contributed to QA I generally learned more about the different test involved in particular feature, the more ways we learn to test the more test case we think while developing software.


### Steps to Follow

One of our Contribute has created a small video for filing the bugs.
